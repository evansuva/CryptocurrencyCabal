<p><div class="due">
Due: Sunday, 8 November at 8:29pm
   </div></p>

<h2 id="purpose:b29158b067a206a408f4a3d38e1dbe1a">Purpose</h2>

<p>The goal of this assignment is for everyone to gain experience analyzing
the blockchain and understanding of the anonymity of bitcoin (and
mechanisms that are used to increase or decrease it), and to hopefully
help the FBI catch some heinous criminals.</p>

<h3 id="collaboration-policy:b29158b067a206a408f4a3d38e1dbe1a">Collaboration Policy</h3>

<p>For this assignment, you may either work alone or with one other person
of your choice.  If you work with a partner, you should together submit
one assignment with both of your names on it that reflects your combined
efforts.  You may, and are encouraged to, discuss all of the problems
with anyone else you want (both on-line using the course web site or any
other means you choose, and in person).</p>

<h3 id="submission:b29158b067a206a408f4a3d38e1dbe1a">Submission</h3>

<p>Submit your answers as a single ZIP file using <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/request/YC25YAa5DV7ejcc49ONC">this
link</a>.  The name
of your file should be <code>&lt;your email ID&gt;-ps3.zip</code> (if you worked alone)
or <code>&lt;partner1 email ID&gt;-&lt;partner2 email ID&gt;-ps3.zip</code>.  Your submission
should include a PDF document containing all your written (non-code)
answers, all of the source code for your programs, and any additional
data you think it useful to provide.</p>

<h2 id="warm-up-manual-exploration:b29158b067a206a408f4a3d38e1dbe1a">Warm-Up: Manual Exploration</h2>

<p>You should have received by email a list of bitcoin addresses that were
given to us by the FBI.  These are addresses that were used to collect
ransom payments from victims of bitcoin ransomware attacks.  In the
scheme perpetrators encrypt a victim’s files and then demand that ransom
payment be made to a specific bitcoin address in return for the key to
decrypt the files.</p>

<p>One of the addresses are marked with your email ID.  The intent of this
is to ensure that the examination efforts are well distributed over the
provided addresses.  For the manual exploration question, you should
start with that address (but feel free to look at any of the addresses
in the file, and for the programmatic analysis questions, you&rsquo;ll want to
use all the addresses).</p>

<p>You can use any tool you want to answer these questions, but we suggest
using <a href="http://blockchain.info">blockchain.info</a>.  One useful thing you
can do there is look at the taint analysis to see which other addresses
a given addresses is interacting with (e.g., examine the <a href="https://blockchain.info/taint/14TCv5MKcyYCM3qij36x8xrKvKHHY1NXmq?reversed=true">reverse taint
analysis</a>
to see the addresses that are receiving bitcoin from the given address).</p>

<p><div class="problem">
<strong>Problem 1.</strong><br />
(a) What address are you investigating?<br />
(b) When was that address in use?<br />
&#40;c) How many victims appear to have paid into the address?<br />
(d) How much was collected from each victim (the most relevant value would be the value in US dollars at the time of the payment)?  Did all the victims pay the same amount, or did the requested amount vary by victim?<br />
(e) How did the ransomist (owner of this address) distribute the proceeds?  Is there a percentage split, or some other fee being paid by the ransomist to other addresses?<br />
(f) What else can you learn about the operation starting from your transaction?<br />
(g) <strong>Added 4 Nov: If you are answering Problem 1 after class Wednesday, also answer</strong>: How is your address similar to and different from what has been observed by other students for other addresses?
   </div></p>

<p>Since our goal is to learn as much as we can about the overall
operation, you should post your answers to Problem 1 (for your address)
as a <a href="#comments">comment on this page</a>.</p>

<h2 id="privacy-in-the-blockchain:b29158b067a206a408f4a3d38e1dbe1a">Privacy in the Blockchain</h2>

<p>The questions in the section focus on this paper:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://conferences2.sigcomm.org/imc/2013/papers/imc182-meiklejohnA.pdf"><em>A Fistful of Bitcoins: Characterizing Payments among Men (sic) with No Names</em></a> by Sarah Meiklejohn, Marjori Pomarole, Grant Jordan, Kirill Levchenko, Damon McCoy, Geoffrey M. Voelker, and Stefan Savage.  <em>Internet Measurement Conference</em>, 2013.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should also read:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://bitcoin-class.org/docs/princeton-book/chapter_6.pdf"><em>Chapter 6: Bitcoin and Anonymity</em></a>,
from Arvind Narayanan, Joseph Bonneau, Edward Felten, Andrew Miller,
Steven Goldfeder. <a href="https://piazza.com/princeton/spring2015/btctech/resources"><em>Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency
Technologies</em></a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><div class="problem">
<strong>Problem 2.</strong> Part of the strategy used in the
Sarah Meiklejohn et al. paper was for the authors to open accounts with services and conduct transactions with questionable merchants.<br />
(a) Why was it useful to actually conduct transactions with merchants operating in dark markets to conduct this research?<br />
(b) What ethical and legal issues does contudcting a transaction with a questionable merchant raise?<br />
   </div></p>

<p><div class="problem">
<strong>Problem 3.</strong> The Heuristic 1 (Section 4.3) used to detemine sets of
public addresses owned by the same entity is based on the assumption
that all inputs to a bitcoin transaction are controlled by the same
entity.  According to the paper, &ldquo;the sender in the transaction must
know the private signing key belonging to each public key used as an
input, so it is unlikely that the collection of public keys are
controlled by multiple entities (as these entities would need to reveal
their private keys to each other).&rdquo;  Explain why this is not actually
true. (A good answer will consider in more detail what is needed in the
unlocking script to spend each input.)
   </div></p>

<p><div class="problem">
<strong>Problem 4.</strong> The analysis in this paper was done before hierarchical
deterministic wallets became standard.  How does the widespread use of
HD wallets today impact the effectiveness of their Heuristic 2?
   </div></p>

<h2 id="blockchain-apis:b29158b067a206a408f4a3d38e1dbe1a">Blockchain APIs</h2>

<p>One way to analyze the blockchain is to run a full bitcoin node, and
operate on your own local copy of the blockchain.  This requires
downloading and processing a large amount of data (approximately <a href="https://blockchain.info/charts/blocks-size">45
GB</a> today).  Instead, you
can use an external service that provides an API for interacting with
the blockchain.  Several such APIs exist including
<a href="https://blockchain.info/api">blockchain.info</a>, Bitpay&rsquo;s <a href="https://insight.is/">Insight
API</a>, and BlockCypher&rsquo;s <a href="http://dev.blockcypher.com/">Blockchain
API</a>.</p>

<p>For this assignment, you are welcome to use any services and open source
bitcoin libraries and openly-licensed code you want, but must follow the
license requirements of any code you use and credit this code in your
submission.</p>

<p>The starting examples we provide will use Python and the BlockCypher
<a href="http://dev.blockcypher.com/">Blockchain API</a>, and we provide some
directions to get started using this next (but feel free to use other
tools if you prefer).</p>

<h3 id="setting-up-blockcypher-api:b29158b067a206a408f4a3d38e1dbe1a">Setting up BlockCypher API</h3>

<p><strong>Install Python.</strong> Start by downloading and installing Python
  (<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-350/">https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-350/</a>.
  Note that Python V3 is incompatible with Python V2 (on MacOSX, the
  default <code>python</code> is Python 2.7.2; to use Python 3, use <code>python3</code>).
  Even if you are not familiar with Python, if you feel comfortable
  learning a new language on the fly you should be fine jumping right
  into this assignment. If you prefer a more structured intro to Python
  there are many tutorials available, including
  <a href="http://www.learnpython.org/">http://www.learnpython.org/</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Install the Blockcypher Python library.</strong> The <a href="https://github.com/blockcypher/blockcypher-python">BlockCypher Python
  library</a> provides a
  convenient way to use the APIs.  To install it, execute <code>pip install
  blockcypher</code> (in the command shell).</p>

<p>Here is some example code that uses the BlockCypher API to find all the
addresses which received bitcoin directly from a sending address:</p>

<pre><code class="language-Python">import blockcypher

def get_receivers(sending_address):
    receiving_addresses = set()
    r = blockcypher.get_address_details(sending_address)
    for tx in r['txrefs']: # loop through all transactions
        hash = tx['tx_hash']
        transaction = blockcypher.get_transaction_details(hash)
        # was this address an input
        sender = False
        for input in transaction['inputs']:
            if sending_address in input['addresses']:
                sender = True
                break
        if sender:
            for output in transaction['outputs']:
                for adr in output['addresses']:
                    receiving_addresses.add((adr, output['value']))

    return receiving_addresses

def satoshi_to_BTC(sval):
    return sval / 100000000

sender = '1Ez69SnzzmePmZX3WpEzMKTrcBF2gpNQ55'
print (&quot;Received from &quot; + sender + &quot;: &quot;)
for receiver in get_receivers(sender):
    print(&quot;   &quot; + receiver[0] + &quot; (&quot; + str(satoshi_to_BTC(receiver[1])) + &quot; BTC)&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>To avoid API limits, you will want to <a href="https://accounts.blockcypher.com/">obtain an API
key</a>, and add an <code>api_key=APIKEY</code>
parameter to your requests:</p>

<pre><code class="language-Python">   txdetails = blockcypher.get_transaction_details(tx, api_key=API_KEY)
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use direct web API requests:</p>

<pre><code class="language-Python">     r = requests.get('https://api.blockcypher.com/v1/btc/main/addrs/' + adr 
       	 	       + '/full', params={'token': API_KEY}).json() 
</code></pre>

<p>To learn if an address is connected with a known wallet, you can use the
<a href="http://WalletExplorer.com">WalletExplorer.com</a> API (note the
WalletExporer API is not publicly documented, but Aleš Janda, the
WalletExplorer developer, kindly made it available to us):</p>

<pre><code class="language-Python">def address_display(adr):
    try:
        r = requests.get('https://www.walletexplorer.com/api/1/address-lookup?address=' 
		         + adr + '&amp;caller=virginia.edu').json()
        return adr + &quot; (&quot; + r['label'] + &quot;)&quot;
    except:
        return adr
</code></pre>

<h2 id="mixing-services:b29158b067a206a408f4a3d38e1dbe1a">Mixing Services</h2>

<p>Before looking at the ransomware addresses, get some practice using a
blockchain API by examining a simple mixer (as far as we can tell, the
ransomwarists are not actually using any mixing service, though).</p>

<p>In transaction
<a href="https://blockchain.info/tx/0197dabc3c31c8221b5d7883a9d03240bcf7a3042e1bf6dcc26c8d3aa60c58ab">0197dabc3c31c8221b5d7883a9d03240bcf7a3042e1bf6dcc26c8d3aa60c58ab</a>,
Dave sent 0.01523 BTC to the mixing service
<a href="https://bitmixer.io">BitMixer.io</a>.</p>

<p>BitMixer is a mixing service for the impatient - it will send the input
amount, less the collected fees, to the requested output address
immediately after the input transaction is confirmed (a single
confirmation is enough for small amounts, so the mixer output
transaction is very likely to be in the next block in the blockchain).
(In this case, Block 379818).</p>

<p>Note BitMixer&rsquo;s <a href="https://bitmixer.io/fees.html">fee structure</a>: &ldquo;Our
minimum fee is 0.5% plus 0.0005 BTC for every forward address.  We
recommend to set higher custom fee to prevent advanced amount-based
blockchain analysis.&rdquo;  (They don&rsquo;t, to many customers dismay, actually
make any promises about their maximum fee.)</p>

<p><div class="problem">
<strong>Problem 5.</strong> Assuming you know the output
transaction is in the block immediately following the input transaction
and that BitMixer&rsquo;s actual fee on this transaction is between 0.5% +
0.0005 BTC and 0.6% + 0.0005 BTC (but don&rsquo;t know anything else), how big
is the anonymity set for the output transaction?  (Hint: use the
blockcypher API to look at all the output values for transactions in the
target block.)</p>

<p></div></p>

<p><div class="problem">
<strong>Challenge Bonus.</strong> Which address is the output address?  Your answer
  should include (a) a wager amount indicating your confidence (up to 10
  points), which you win or lose depending on the correctness of your
  answer, and (b) an explanation of why you think that is the actual
  output address.
   </div></p>

<p><div class="problem">
<strong>Problem 6.</strong> The <a href="https://bitmixer.io/why.html">BitMixer.io</a> site
  suggests, &ldquo;In order to further enhance the security of your
  transactions we provide the opportunity to use two or more forward
  addresses as well as convenient time delays.&rdquo;  How much does it enhance anonymity to split your output across two forward addresses?  (A good answer will get into how using two forward addresses impacts both the size of the anonymity set and the computational cost of performining the de-anonymizing analysis.  A great answer would actually test this by examining the blockchain to get a concrete result.)
   </div></p>

<h2 id="follow-the-ransomware-money:b29158b067a206a408f4a3d38e1dbe1a">Follow the Ransomware Money</h2>

<p>Now it’s time to follow the money!  We&rsquo;ll provide a few hints for things
to do, but you should use these as starting points and form your own
ideas about ways to explore the blockchain.</p>

<p>First, we examine the direct transactions involving the ransomware
addresses (in the <code>suspects.txt</code> file provided to you).  Since we know
these addresses were used to collect money from ransomware victims, we
are more interested in looking at transactions where bitcoin is sent
from the ransomware collection addresses to other addresses.</p>

<p><div class="problem">
<strong>Problem 7.</strong> Write a program that reads in a file containing suspect
addresses (e.g., the <code>suspects.txt</code> file containing the ransomware
payment addresses that was sent to you), and examines the blockchain to
find addresses that receive bitcoin from the suspect addresses.  By
using the WalletExplorer API, you should be able to find some
interesting transactions, including one where the ransomware address
sent bitcoin to an address WalletExplorer identifies as being
&ldquo;BitPay.com-old&rdquo;.  Report on any interesting transactions found by your
program.<br />
   </div></p>

<p>If the criminals are more careful, they should avoid making any
revealing transactions directly from the collection addresses, and
instead try to hide their money flows by making lots of transfers
between other addresses (or, if they trust a mixnet operator
sufficiently, use a mixer to disconnect their money trail).</p>

<p>So, we want to figure out if there are any common addresses that
eventually receive coin from more than one of the starting
addresses. This could detect if the suspect addresses are running
received coins through a mixnet, but outputting to the same address
eventually, which could mean payments to the same vendor.</p>

<p>A good approach to this problem could be writing a program that
iteratively follows successive outputs from a series of seed addresses
down to a reasonable depth and then checks for overlap between sets.  We
want to find addresses that eventually receive bitcoin sent from more
than one of the ransom collection addresses, since these are likely to
be addresses involved in meaningful transactions.</p>

<p><div class="problem">
<strong>Problem 8.</strong> Write a program that reads in a file containing suspect
addresses (e.g., the <code>suspects.txt</code> file containing the ransomware
payment addresses that was sent to you), and outputs a list of all the
addresses that eventually receive bitcoin from more than one of the
suspect addresses.  The receiving addresses are not limited to direct
transactions, but could receive funds through a sequence of transactions
starting from suspect addresses.  From the ransonware payment addresses
you should be able to find at least 34 such addresses (including the
<code>18dwCxqqmya2ckWjCgTYReYyRL6dZF6pzL</code> address which was already known to
the FBI to have been used by the ransomware operation.)<br />
   </div></p>

<p>We are also interested in finding out the relative importance of the
addresses found. You can determine this based on factors such as amount
of bitcoins they receive, number of seed addresses they are associated
with, or how many hops away the addresses are on average from associated
seed addresses.  You can also use the
<a href="http://WalletExplorer.com">WalletExplorer.com</a> API to see if the
addresses found are associated with known wallets.</p>

<p><div class="problem">
<strong>Problem 9.</strong> Improve your program to provide additional information
  about the addresses found, and order the addresses according to the
  total value they received connected to the starting addresses.
   </div></p>

<p>The final problem is open-ended.  Your goal is to hopefully find some
information that would be useful to the FBI, or short of that, to at
least impress your classmates.</p>

<p>We have a few suggested options below (from which you can select one to
do). If you have a better idea for what to do, though, feel free to do
that instead.  If you want to do anything that involves interacting with
criminals, though, please discuss your idea with the course staff and
get permission before doing anything potentially risky!</p>

<p><div class="problem">
<strong>Problem 10 (option 1).</strong> Develop and implement a new strategy for exploring the
  ransomware transactions, and report on what you find.
   </div></p>

<p><div class="problem">
<strong>Problem 10 (option 2).</strong> Try applying your programs to other interesting sets of
  addresses.  There are lots of potential sources of such addresses,
  including, of course, searching the blockchain itself for addresses
  involved in interesting transactions.  (You can also look at posts such as <a href="http://www.theopenledger.com/9-most-famous-bitcoin-addresses/">9 Infamous Bitcoin Addresses</a> or Blockchain.info&rsquo;s <a href="https://blockchain.info/popular-addresses?show_adv=true">list of popular addresses</a>.)
   </div></p>

<p><div class="problem">
<strong>Problem 10 (option 3).</strong> Figure out how a mixing service like
  BitMixer.io (or select another one) works, and how much anonymity it
  really provides.
   </div></p>
